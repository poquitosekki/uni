# uni

University stuff that you wouldn't even think of visiting to be honest...

## Me? 

Sekki :)

## Naming convention 

* `[Semester]-[Course]-(Type)`
* Example : `S4 Comptabilité de Gestion 2` -> `S4-CG2` 
* The type tag is just optional if you wanna specify what this file is for, ig: notes, slides, support...

## About

This is my main repositroy for posting notes for multiple uni courses (ENCGM), I started in S4 doing this stuff here instead of uploading them privately on my personal Google Drive.

* The future of this project is still not clear, maybe no one will contribute and that's fine i guess.

* Learn about git & github (at least the basics). 
* Respect the naming convestions, we don't want to make a mess in this repo.
