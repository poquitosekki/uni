# uni

University stuff that you wouldn't even think of visiting to be honest...

## Naming convention 

  * `[Semester]-[Course]-(Type)`
  * Example : `S4 ComptabilitÃ© de Gestion 2` -> `S4-CG2` 
  * The type tag is just optional if you wanna specify what this file is for, ig: notes, slides, support...

## About

This is my main repositroy for posting notes for multiple uni courses (ENCGM), I started in S4 doing this stuff here instead of uploading them privately on my personal Google Drive.
